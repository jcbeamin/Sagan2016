1.2 Spectroscopic Light Curves  
It is important to understand how shape of a transit will change with wavelength. Using the 1D
stellar spectra as a function of time, derive a white-light (summed over all wavelength) light curve
(as a function of time). By measurement (or by eye) estimate the depth of the transit. Given that
the transit depth is (Rp/R?)^2, what is your rough estimate of the planet radius? Use the stellar
spectrum as a guide for the stellar type/size. Think about what combination of stellar types and
planets might give a similar transit depth. Describe why small stars (M dwarfs) make advantageous
host stars. Now create light curves for spectral resolutions (R∼ λ/∆λ) of roughly 10 and 100.
Investigate how the transit shape/depth changes as a function of wavelength. At what wavelengths
is the limb-darkening effect the strongest?
